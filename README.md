## Hey there! Welcome to my cybersecurity adventure!

#So, I'm putting together this little corner of the internet to show off my cybersecurity journey. It's still a work in progress, but here's what I'm planning to share:

#- Cool stuff I've done on TryHackMe and HackTheBox (once I actually do them, that is!)
#- Skills I'm picking up along the way, like poking around networks, figuring out web security, and getting comfy with Linux
#- My ongoing quest to learn about ethical hacking, penetration testing, and all that OSINT goodness

## A bit about me

#I'm just a regular person who's fallen head over heels for cybersecurity. Every day, I'm amazed by how much cool stuff there is to learn in this field. It's like being a digital detective, and I'm loving every minute of it!

## Stay tuned!

#This website is still cooking, but I promise it'll be worth the wait. I'll be posting updates on all the cybersecurity shenanigans I get up to, so check back soon!

#Thanks for stopping by! If you're into cybersecurity too, or just curious about it, I'd love to chat. Let's make the internet a safer place together, one line of code at a time!
